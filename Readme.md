OSX PDF Toolkit
=======
Because some tools such as PDFTk no longer work on OSX El Capitan we thought we might share a few tools which are helpful under OSX. 
Please feel free to submit new tools. Try to write them in python and avoid using third party libraries if possible. 

burstpdf

This utility will burst (split) your PDF into separate files. Usage:
```
python burstpdf.py <PDF file> <Output directory> <Frist Page> <Last Page>
```

cat
-----
This tool extracts specific pages out of your PDF document. Usage:
